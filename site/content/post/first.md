Affinity Diagramming 
-------

Affinity Diagramming is a very simple but powerful technique for grouping and understanding information.

In particular, affinity diagramming provides a good way to identify and analyze issues. There are several variations of the technique.
When is affinity diagramming appropriate?

Use affinity diagramming in a workshop environment when you want participants to work together identifying, grouping and discussing issues.

How is affinity diagramming conducted?

Affinity diagramming simply consists of placing related items together.

Although this can be done electronically for very small sets of data (using a word processor or spreadsheet program), it is better to work with paper. In group situations, always use paper.

If you have a pre-existing set of information, you can print these on labels or card, or print on paper and guillotine to a convenient size.

In a group situation, begin by handing out Post-It(tm) notes.

Ask participants to write one issue on each note.

Give participants some minutes for this activity, but ask them to stop when a large majority of participants have stopped.

Get all participants to gather at a vertical surface suitable for Post-It notes. Windows are appropriate.
